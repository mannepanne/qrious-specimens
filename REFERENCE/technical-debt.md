Tracks known limitations, shortcuts, and deferred improvements in the codebase.
Items here are accepted risks or pragmatic choices made during development, not bugs.

## Active technical debt

### TD-001: Phase 1 committed directly to main
- **Location:** Git history — all Phase 1 commits
- **Issue:** The bootstrapping work (infrastructure setup, Supabase schema, Vite scaffold, first deployment) was committed directly to `main` with no feature branches or PRs. This violated the project's core workflow rule.
- **Why accepted:** Pragmatic exception for initial project bootstrapping — there was no established `main` to branch from, no collaborators, and the work was foundational rather than incremental. Reviewed post-hoc via `/review-pr`.
- **Risk:** Low — the code has been reviewed. The risk is habit-setting: this must not become a pattern.
- **Future fix:** No code change needed. From Phase 2 onwards, all work uses feature branches + PRs without exception. Zero exceptions.
- **Phase introduced:** Phase 1

### Example Format: TD-001: Description
- **Location:** `src/path/to/file.ts` - `functionName()`
- **Issue:** Clear description of the limitation or shortcut
- **Why accepted:** Reason for accepting this debt (e.g., runtime constraints, time pressure, lack of alternative)
- **Risk:** Low/Medium/High - Impact assessment
- **Future fix:** Proposed solution when time/resources allow
- **Phase introduced:** Phase number when this was added

## Notes

- Items are prefixed TD-NNN for easy reference in code comments and PR reviews
- When adding new debt, include: location, issue description, why accepted, risk level, and proposed future fix
- Review this list at the start of each development phase to see if any items should be addressed
- Low-risk items can remain indefinitely; High-risk items should be addressed within 2-3 phases
